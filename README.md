# Arabic-ModernBERT
We introduce a new version of ModernBERT for Arabic. Originally built for English, we retrained it on a large Arabic dataset and adjusted it for tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, and question answering. Our tests show it performs nearly as well as AraBERT, proving that adapting strong English models to Arabic is a promising approach.
